# Localized Gradient Density MPF/G-code Post Processor

This script will replace bounded infill areas in MPF/G-code files with single location extrusions approximating a lower density infill. This is made to process files in the MPF format generated by Additec ElemX Builder 3.4.4 (formerly owned by Xerox) to be printed on the ElemX Plus additive printer.

The bounded area is specified similar to a modifier cube in 3D slicer software. Bounding box for modified infill volume is set in `testBoundingBox` in `mpf_post_process.py`.

The new infill is only placed where previous layers have modified infill so that the infill stacks on top of lower layers. A 50% overlap is currently hardcoded.

Most constants are defined in the `constants.py` file and classes defined for printing are in `printing_classes.py`.

The input and output files can be set at the bottom of `mpf_post_process.py` by modifying the line

```python
process(inputFilepath='test-square.mpf', outputFilepath='test-square-output.mpf')
```
